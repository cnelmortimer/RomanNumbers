# ![RomanNumbers icon](./Resources/RomanNumbersIconPNG.png) RomanNumbers

_RomanNumbers_ is a bidirectional roman-decimal converter for Haiku. It features both a complete GUI and a slim console. It allows long range conversion in range [1, 2147483647] by using the parentheses notation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals for further information.

The main window of the GUI is shown next:

Finally, you can also convert numbers from the console by simply executing the program with the number to convert as its argument. That execution mode is shown next:

Enjoy the program and feel free to report any error that you find.

Note: The program should compile and work on BeOS R5 and Zeta 1.2.1 or higher too.
